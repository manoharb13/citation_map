The performance of this system in detecting living victims under the rubble has been tested in a high-ﬁdelity simulated disaster area. Results show that the CO2 sensor is useful to effectively reduce the possible concerned area, while the thermal camera can conﬁrm the correct position of the victim. Moreover, it is believed that the use of microphones in connection with other sensors would be of great beneﬁt for the detection of casualties.

Two complementary methods were employed to predict performance. The first solves the heat balance equation for the bolometer in its circuit and its thermal environment with known values of heat capacitance, thermal conductance, absorptance, temperature coefficient of resistance and the userdefined bias current (either constant or pulsed). This iteration yields a bolometer temperature rise, and a corresponding change in resistance and voltage. This is the signal part of the equation. The second method is required to calculate the total bolometer noise. It uses equations derived from the literature to predict bolometer noise, response, NEP and NETD from first principles for the four types of noise generated in thermal detectors (thermal fluctuation noise, background fluctuation noise, johnson noise and 1/f noise). Thermal conductance and heat capacities are calculated using all the elements of the bolometer structure such as the silicon nitride structure, the VOx coating, and the nichrome electrical leads. Using a calculation of the full spectral irradiance on the bolometer from the scene and the dewar and a userdefined bolometer element spectral absorption, the model will accurately assess performance in any environment. The model also employs a 3-D noise model and provides synthetic images of PSF-blurred bar targets for NETD and MRTD predictions.","2006-08-31","2019-11-26 06:33:14","2019-11-26 06:33:14","2019-11-26 06:33:14","62940F","","","","","","","","","","","","San Diego, California, USA","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\EMPTY_COLLECTION_NAME\2006_Richwine et al_A comprehensive model for bolometer element and uncooled array design and.pdf","","","","Longshore, Randolph E.; Sood, Ashok","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SPIE Optics + Photonics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Flow boiling is susceptible to instabilities that can lead to maldistribution between the channels and thereby heat transfer performance reductions. In this study, the Ledinegg instability that occurs during ﬂow boiling in two thermally isolated parallel microchannels is studied experimentally. A dielectric liquid (HFE-7100) is delivered to the parallel channels using a constant pressure source. Both channels are uniformly subjected to the same power, which is in increased in steps. Flow visualization is conducted simultaneously with pressure drop, mass ﬂux, and wall temperature measurements to characterize the thermal-ﬂuidic effects of the Ledinegg instability. When the ﬂow in both channels is in the single-phase regime, they have equal wall temperatures due to evenly distributed mass ﬂux delivered to each channel. Boiling incipience in one of the channels triggers the Ledinegg instability which induces a temperature difference between the two channels due to ﬂow maldistribution. The temperature difference between the two channels grows with increasing power until boiling incipience occurs in the second channel. The wall temperatures of both channels then reduce signiﬁcantly as the ﬂow becomes more evenly distributed. The experimentally observed temperature excursion between the channels is reported here for the ﬁrst time and provides an improved understanding of the thermal performance implications of the Ledinegg instability in thermally isolated parallel channels.","2019-04","2019-12-09 12:06:52","2019-12-09 12:06:53","2019-12-09 12:06:52","550-556","","","132","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\EMPTY_COLLECTION_NAME\2019_International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer_Kingston et al_Ledinegg instability-induced temperature excursion between thermally isolated,.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among approaches for heat dissipation, thin-ﬁlm evaporation with micro/nanostructures has been one of the most promising approaches that can address future technological demand. The geometry and dimension of these micro/nanostructures directly govern the interfacial heat ﬂux. Here, through theoretical and experimental analysis, we ﬁnd that there is an optimal dimension of micro/nanostructures that maximizes the interfacial heat ﬂux by thin-ﬁlm evaporation. This optimal criterion is a consequence of two opposing phenomena: nonuniform evaporation ﬂux across a liquid meniscus (divergent mass ﬂux near the three-phase contact line) and the total liquid area exposed for evaporation. In vertical micro/nanostructures, the optimal width-to-spacing ratio is 1.27 for square pillars and 1.5 for wires (e.g., nanowires). This general criterion is independent of the solid material and the thermophysical properties of the cooling liquid. At the optimal width-to-spacing ratio, as the density of the pillars increases (i.e., smaller pillar’s dimension), the interfacial heat ﬂux increases.

Four different wick geometries representing common wicks used in heat pipes, viz., wire mesh, rectangular grooves, sintered wicks and vertical microwires, are modeled and compared for evaporative performance. The solid–liquid combination considered is copper–water. Steady evaporation is modeled and the liquid–vapor interface shape is assumed to be static during evaporation. Liquid–vapor interface shapes in different geometries are obtained by solving the Young–Laplace equation using Surface Evolver. Mass, momentum and energy equations are solved numerically in the liquid domain, with the vapor assumed to be saturated. Evaporation at the interface is modeled by using heat and mass transfer rates obtained from kinetic theory. Thermocapillary convection due to non-isothermal conditions at the interface is modeled for all geometries and its role in heat transfer enhancement from the interface is quantiﬁed for both low and high superheats. More than 80% of the evaporation heat transfer is noted to occur from the thin-ﬁlm region of the liquid meniscus. The very small Capillary and Weber numbers resulting from the small ﬂuid velocities near the interface for low superheats validate the assumption of a static liquid meniscus shape during evaporation. Solid–liquid contact angle, wick porosity, solid–vapor superheat and liquid level in the wick pore are varied to study their effects on evaporation from the liquid meniscus.","2011-01","2019-12-18 03:03:37","2019-12-18 03:03:37","2019-12-18 03:03:37","169-179","","1-3","54","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\Evaporation paper\2011_International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer_Ranjan et al_A microscale model for thin-film evaporation in capillary wick structures.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Solar energy can be utilized in steam and vapor generation processes which has a great importance in many engineering applications such as water desalination, domestic water heating, and power generation. However, dilute solar flux (∼1000 W/m2) cannot supply the absorber with enough power required to overcome water latent heat of vaporization to evaporate water. Optical concentrators such as parabolic trough collector, parabolic dish reflector, and circular Fresnel lens can be used to concentrate the solar radiation to achieve the required power however they suffer from complexity and high cost. Moreover, the efficiency of the conventional solar desalination devices such as solar stills decreases dramatically with increasing bulk water quantity, due to the heat loss to bulk water. Therefore, the need to solar steam generation (SG) devices, that localize heating on a thin layer of water rather than the water bulk, arises. Thin film technology has shown promising progress in SG in which solar energy is utilized to wastewater desalination. The past five years have seen a significant surge in the development of thin film based SG devices. In this review, recently developed thin film-based SG devices are scrutinized with respect to their physical mechanisms, fabrication methods, structure, advantages, and disadvantages. Different types of thin-film materials, including: metal-based nanoparticles, metal oxides, carbon-based materials, polymers, etc.; as well as different substrates materials, including: wood, paper, cotton fabric, carbon fabric, polystyrene foam, and gauze, have been discussed. Moreover, different preparation and synthetization methods of the steam generation devices have been discussed. Suggestions for future research directions are also presented.","2019-01","2020-03-17 23:50:37","2020-03-17 23:50:37","2020-03-17 23:50:37","561-575","","","177","","Solar Energy","Thin film technology for solar steam generation","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\Evaporation paper\2019_Solar Energy_Elsheikh et al_Thin film technology for solar steam generation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extremely high heat removal rates are achieved in this work using a hierarchical manifold microchannel heat sink array. The microchannels are imbedded directly into the heated substrate to reduce the parasitic thermal resistances due to contact and conduction resistances. Discretizing the chip footprint area into multiple smaller heat sink elements with high-aspect-ratio microchannels ensures shortened effective ﬂuid ﬂow lengths. Phase change of high ﬂuid mass ﬂuxes can thus be accommodated in micron-scale channels while keeping pressure drops low compared to traditional, microchannel heat sinks. A thermal test vehicle, with all ﬂow distribution components heterogeneously integrated, is fabricated to demonstrate this enhanced thermal and hydraulic performance. The 5 mm Â 5 mm silicon chip area, with resistive heaters and local temperature sensors fabricated directly on the opposite face, is cooled by a 3 Â 3 array of microchannel heat sinks that are fed with coolant using a hierarchical manifold distributor. Using the engineered dielectric liquid HFE-7100 as the working ﬂuid, experimental results are presented for channel mass ﬂuxes of 1300, 2100, and 2900 kg/m2 s and channel cross sections with nominal widths of 15 lm and nominal depths of 35 lm, 150 lm, and 300 lm. Maximum heat ﬂux dissipation is shown to increase with mass ﬂux and channel depth and the heat sink with 15 lm Â 300 lm channels is shown to dissipate base heat ﬂuxes up to 910 W/cm2 at pressure drops of less than 162 kPa and chip temperature rise under 47 °C relative to the ﬂuid inlet temperature.","2018-02","2020-03-18 16:59:46","2020-03-18 16:59:46","2020-03-18 16:59:46","319-330","","","117","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\Evaporation paper\2018_International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer_Drummond et al_A hierarchical manifold microchannel heat sink array for high-heat-flux.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They include macroscale, microscale, and nanoscale surfaces, as well as multiscale (hybrid-scale), and hybrid-wettability techniques. Different enhancement methods are assessed in terms of underlying ﬂuid routing mechanisms and ability to achieve three distinct heat transfer goals: eliminating incipient boiling hysteresis, increasing nucleate boiling heat transfer coefﬁcient, and ameliorating critical heat ﬂux (CHF), especially for inert dielectric coolants that are both highly wetting and possess relatively poor thermophysical properties. While different enhancement scales are shown to provide different degrees of success in achieving the three goals, it is shown that both microscale and nanoscale surface features are susceptible to blockage, resulting in deterioration of the enhancement over time. This review also points to scarcity of sufﬁciently sized databases for a given enhancement scheme in terms of ﬂuid type, surface material, size, and orientation, enhancement shape, pattern, and scale, and operating pressure.

Evaporation cooling for electronics systems has been considered one of the most promising approaches for meeting the demands of high-powered technologies by taking advantage of their latent heat. Integrating microscale or nanoscale features into two-phase microﬂuidic cooling systems such as porous media can dramatically increase the area of liquid-vapor interfaces where phonons translate thermal energy to ﬂuid enthalpy. To achieve this performance jump, it is essential to understand how the engineered features improve evaporative heat transfer performance. In this study, we investigate thin-ﬁlm evaporation performance within crystalline pore surfaces by employing simulation models that examine solid-liquid contact lines and liquid-vapor interfaces. The simulation models compute detailed performance parameters including phase volume fraction, temperature, pressure proﬁle, and evaporative mass ﬂux as a function of location, allowing us to calculate local heat transfer performance parameters. Based on local heat transfer performances, we identify thin-ﬁlm regions and quantify their fractions to the overall evaporation performance. Area-averaged heat transfer coefﬁcients are compared to identify the morphological effects of varying pore diameters and surface wettability. Insights from this parametric study will allow us to understand how evaporative heat transfer is related to the structural details of porous media and assist us to determine guidelines for the design of evaporating surfaces in modern electronics cooling.","2018-07","2020-03-19 03:04:06","2020-03-19 03:04:07","2020-03-19 03:04:06","59-68","","","122","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\Evaporation paper\2018_International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer_Montazeri et al_Microscopic analysis of thin-film evaporation on spherical pore surfaces.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, predictive tools to design various wicking structures are limited due to the complexity of the thermal–ﬂuidic transport. In this work, we performed systematic experiments to characterize capillary-limited thin-ﬁlm evaporation from silicon micropillar wicks in the absence of nucleate boiling. The insights gained from experiments were used to model the capillary pressure, permeability, and thermal resistance. Accordingly, we developed a semi-analytical model to determine the capillary-limited dryout heat ﬂux and wall temperature with ±20% accuracy, compared to our experiments.

The model considers the absence of bulk fluid at the top surface of the wick, heat conduction resistance through the wick, capillary limitation, and the onset of nucleate boiling. The numerical results show that thin film evaporation occurring only at the top surface of a wick plays an important role in the enhancement of evaporating heat transfer and depends on the thin film evaporation, the particle size, the porosity, and the wick structure thickness. By decreasing the average particle radius, the evaporation heat transfer coefficient can be enhanced. Additionally, there exists an optimum characteristic thickness for maximum heat removal. The maximum superheat allowable for thin film evaporation at the top surface of a wick is presented to be a function of the particle radius, wick porosity, wick structure thickness, and effective thermal conductivity.

The two-layer wick has an upper cap layer dedicated to capillary liquid feeding of a thin base layer below that supports boiling. An array of vertical posts bridges these two layers for liquid feeding, while vents in the cap layer provide an unimpeded pathway for vapor removal from the base wick. The two-layer wick is fabricated using a combination of sintering and laser machining processes. The thermal resistance of the wicks during boiling is characterized in a saturated environment that replicates the capillary-fed working conditions of a vapor chamber evaporator. Thermal characterization tests are ﬁrst performed using conventional single-layer evaporator wicks to analyze the effect of sintered particle size on capillaryfed boiling of water. Of the particle size ranges tested, wicks sintered from 180 to 212 lm-diameter particles provided the best combination of high dryout heat ﬂux and a low boiling resistance. A two-layer evaporator wick comprising particles of this optimal size and a 15 Â 15 array of liquid feeding posts yielded a maximum heat ﬂux dissipation of 485 W/cm2 over a 1 cm2 heat input area while also maintaining a low thermal resistance of only $0.052 K/W. The thermal performance of the two-layer wick is compared against various hybrid and biporous evaporator wicks previously investigated in the literature. While previous wick designs are typically restricted to small areas and low power levels or high surface superheats when dissipating such heat ﬂuxes, the unique area-scalability of the two-layer wick design allows it to achieve an unprecedented combination of high total power and low-thermal-resistance heat dissipation over larger areas than were previously possible.","2019-06","2020-04-20 20:35:02","2020-04-20 20:35:02","2020-04-20 20:35:02","1346-1356","","","135","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\Evaporation paper\2019_International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer_Sudhakar et al_Area-scalable high-heat-flux dissipation at low thermal resistance using a.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The evaporation/boiling heat transfer coefficient, characteristics, and CHF were investigated under steady-state conditions for a variety of capillary structures with a range of wick thicknesses, volumetric porosities, and mesh sizes. In Part I of the investigation we describe the wicking fabrication process and experimental test facility and focus on the effects of the capillary wick thickness. In Part II we examine the effects of variations in the volumetric porosity and the mesh size as well as presenting detailed discussions of the evaporation/boiling phenomena from thin capillary wicking structures. An optimal sintering process was developed and employed to fabricate the test articles, which were fabricated using multiple, uniform layers of sintered isotropic copper mesh. This process minimized the interface thermal contact resistance between the heated wall and the capillary wick, as well as enhancing the contact conditions between the layers of copper mesh. Due to the effective reduction in the thermal contact resistance between the wall and capillary wick, both the evaporation/boiling heat transfer coefficient and the critical heat flux (CHF) demonstrated dramatic improvements, with heat transfer coefficients up to 245.5kW∕m2K and CHF values in excess of 367.9W∕cm2, observed. The experimental results indicate that while the evaporation/boiling heat transfer coefficient, which increases with increasing heat flux, is only related to the exposed surface area and is not affected by the capillary wick thickness, the CHF for steady-state operation is strongly dependent on the capillary wick thickness and increases proportionally with increase in the wick thickness. In addition to these observations, the experimental tests and subsequent analysis have resulted in the development of a new evaporation/boiling curve for capillary wicking structures, which provides new physical insights into the unique nature of the evaporation/boiling process in these capillary wicking structures. Sample structures and fabrication processes, as well as the test procedures are described in detail and the experimental results and observations are systematically presented and analyzed.","2006-12-01","2020-04-20 21:25:39","2020-04-20 21:25:40","2020-04-20 21:25:39","1312-1319","","12","128","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\Evaporation paper\2006_Li et al_Evaporation-Boiling in Thin Capillary Wicks (l)—Wick Thickness Effects.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Part I of the investigation described the wicking fabrication process and experimental test facility, and focused on the effects of the capillary wick thickness (ASME J. Heat Transfer., 128, pp. 1312–1319). In Part II, we examine the effects of variations in the volumetric porosity and the mesh size. The experimental results presented here indicate that the critical heat flux (CHF) was strongly dependent on both the mesh size and the volumetric porosity; while the evaporation/boiling heat transfer coefficient was significantly affected by mesh size, but not strongly dependent on the volumetric porosity. The experimental results further illustrate that the menisci at the CHF are located in the corners, formed by the wire and the heated wall and between the wires in both the vertical and horizontal directions. The minimum value of these three menisci determined the maximum capillary pressure generated through the capillary wick. The experimental results and observations are systematically presented and analyzed, and the local bubble and liquid vapor interface dynamics are examined theoretically. Based on the relative relationship between the heat flux and superheat, classic nucleate boiling theory, and the visual observations of the phase-change phenomena, as well as by combining the results obtained here with those obtained in Part I of the investigation, the evaporation/boiling heat transfer regimes in these capillary wicking structures are identified and discussed.","2006-12-01","2020-04-20 21:32:42","2020-04-20 21:32:42","2020-04-20 21:32:42","1320-1328","","12","128","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\Evaporation paper\2006_Li_Peterson_Evaporation-Boiling in Thin Capillary Wicks (II)—Effects of Volumetric Porosity.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Topological and microstructural details of the wick material embedded in a heat pipe help determine its thermal performance. A good understanding of pore-scale transport phenomena is crucial to enhancing heat pipe performance. In this study, pore-scale analysis of thin-ﬁlm evaporation through sintered copper wicks is performed. X-ray microtomography is employed to generate geometrically faithful, feature-preserving meshes. Commercial sintered wicks with particle sizes in the range of 45–60 lm, 106–150 lm and 250–355 lm and with approximately 61% porosity are considered. The capillary pressure, characteristic pore radius, percentage thin ﬁlm area and evaporative mass and heat ﬂuxes are computed using a volume of ﬂuid (VOF) approach. Two different solution strategies are employed to stabilize the numerical solution and to improve convergence. After verifying that these strategies yield the correct solution, the VOF model is used to obtain static meniscus shapes in the pore space of the sintered wick samples. The meniscus shape is then held ﬁxed and steady-state, thin-ﬁlm evaporation analysis is performed. Liquid–vapor phase change heat transfer is modeled using a modiﬁed Schrage equation. Based on the present analysis, the best performing sample (particle size range) is identiﬁed along with the optimum contact angle.","2013-06","2020-04-20 21:39:46","2020-04-20 21:39:46","2020-04-20 21:39:46","729-741","","","61","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\Evaporation paper\2013_International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer_Bodla et al_Evaporation analysis in sintered wick microstructures.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, a new enhancement mechanism based on the early evaporation of the microlayer is discovered and validated. The microlayer is a thin liquid ﬁlm present at the base of a vapor bubble. The presence of microridges on the silicon dioxide surface partitions the microlayer and disconnects it from the bulk liquid, causing it to evaporate sooner, thus leading to increase in the bubble growth rate, heat transfer, departure frequency, and critical heat ﬂux (CHF). Compared to a plain surface, an ∼120% enhancement in CHF is obtained with only an ∼18% increase in surface area. A CHF enhancement map is developed on the basis of the ridge height and spacing, resulting in three regions of full, partial, and no enhancement. The new mechanism is validated by comparing the growth rate of a laser-created vapor bubble on a ridgestructured surface and a plain surface, and the corresponding prediction of the CHF enhancement is found to be in good agreement with the experimental boiling data. This discovery opens up a new ﬁeld of CHF enhancement and can potentially be coupled with existing techniques to further push the limits of boiling heat transfer.","2016-10-25","2020-05-16 18:52:31","2020-05-16 18:52:31","2020-05-16 18:52:31","10808-10814","","42","32","","Langmuir","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\BOiling\surface_modifications\2016_Langmuir_Zou et al_Early Evaporation of Microlayer for Boiling Heat Transfer Enhancement.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The theoretical analysis on four parallel pipes that undergoes a process of heating and evaporation during different heating loads is carried out to indicate all the possible steady-state solutions. Stable solutions and unstable solutions are differentiated through linear stability analysis. It is shown that the more number of heated pipes, the more stable steady state solutions of the splitting ratios, and the greater range of uneven flow rate distribution. Transient analysis is applied to simulate the response of the system to finite disturbances and the performance due to variations in operating conditions by Simulink of Matlab. The results confirm the correctness of the linear stability analysis, and a hysteresis phenomenon is observed when a solution is turning to another solution, even for unstable ones.

Here we report on burnout experiments conducted on fresh and aged heaters in pool boiling. Critical heat ﬂuxes (CHFs) were found to vary from 50% to 140% of the hydrodynamic limit, previously thought to exist at well-wetting conditions. The burnout events were captured in action (for the ﬁrst time), using highspeed, high-resolution infrared thermometry. Based on these observations and in conjunction with the levels of CHF reached, we are led to conclude that the phenomenon cannot be (macro)hydrodynamically limited, at least at normal pressure and gravity conditions. Based on infrared thermometry, and aided by X-ray radiography data on void fraction, the case for a scale separation phenomenon in high heat ﬂux pool boiling is argued. This indicates that boiling crisis is controlled by the microhydrodynamics and rupture of an extended liquid microlayer, sitting and vaporizing autonomously on the heater surface. Further, the detailed dynamics of this microlayer, as revealed by our experiments, demonstrates that all previous thermally based models of boiling crisis are inappropriate.","2002","2020-05-28 22:10:05","2020-05-28 22:10:05","","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\BOiling\visualizations\2002_Theofanous et al_The boiling crisis phenomenon Part II.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both CW and transient (i.e. pulsed and digitally modulated) thermal resistances are calculated for a range of transistor structures and sizes as a function of power density, pulse length and duty factor and compared with measured channel temperatures and RF parameters.

A Finite Element-based conjugate heat transfer model is developed, validated experimentally and used to determine the optimal minichannel width and number of minichannels for a case with a uniform heat ﬂux of 100 W/cm2. The optimisation process uses a 30 point Optimal Latin Hypercubes Design of Experiments, generated from a permutation genetic algorithm, and accurate metamodels built using a Moving Least Square approach. A Pareto front is then constructed to enable the compromises available between designs with a low pressure drop and those with low thermal resistance to be explored and an appropriate minichannel width and number of minichannels to be chosen. These parameters are then used within conjugate heat transfer models of a serpentine MCHS with silicon, silicon carbide, diamond and graphene heat spreaders placed above a GaN HEMT heating source of area 4.8 × 0.8 mm2, generating 1823 W/ cm2. A nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) layer with thickness of 2 µm is mounted on the top surface of the GaN HEMT to function as a heat spreader to mitigate the hot spots. The eﬀect of volumetric ﬂow rate and heat spreader thickness on the chip temperature has been investigated numerically and each of these has been shown to be inﬂuential. For example, at a volumetric ﬂow rate of 0.10 l/min, the maximum chip temperature can be reduced from 124.7 °C to 96.7 °C by employing a 25 µm thick graphene heat spreader attached to the serpentine MCHS together with a NCD layer compared with a serpentine MCHS without these heat spreaders.","2018-07","2020-08-27 05:46:30","2020-08-27 05:46:30","2020-08-27 05:46:30","622-636","","","140","","Applied Thermal Engineering","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\NEPTUNE Project\GaN HEMT\2018_Applied Thermal Engineering_Al-Neama et al_Thermal management of GaN HEMT devices using serpentine minichannel heat sinks.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A typical thermal solution in flip chip technology utilizes two levels of thermal interface materials: between the die and the heat spreader, and between the heat spreader and the heat sink. Phase change materials and thermal greases are among the most prominent interstitial thermal interface materials (TIM) used in electronic packaging. These TIMs are typically polymeric matrix loaded with highly conducting filler particles. The dwindling thermal budget has necessitated a better understanding of the thermal resistance of each component of the thermal solution. Thermal conductivity of these particle-laden materials is better understood than their contact resistance. A careful review of the literature reveals the lack of analytical models for the prediction of contact resistance of these types of interstitial materials, which possess fluidic properties. This paper introduces an analytical model for the thermal contact resistance of these types of interstitial materials. This model is compared with the experimental data obtained on the contact resistance of these TIMs. The model, which depends on parameters such as, surface tension, contact angle, thermal conductivity, roughness and pressure matches very well with the experimental data at low pressures and is still within the error bars at higher pressures.","2001-10-01","2020-09-10 04:19:46","2020-09-10 04:19:46","2020-09-10 04:19:46","969-975","","5","123","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\ME511\2001_Prasher_Surface Chemistry and Characteristics Based Model for the Thermal Contact.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effect of the solder thickness on the heat transfer between the copper surfaces was studied by measuring the thermal contact conductance using the laser flash method. Increasing the thickness of solder from 10 to 30 mm was found to increase the heat transfer time (temperature rise time) by 25%. The effect is akin to replacing solder with an interface material that is 80% lower in thermal conductivity. It is also akin to decreasing the thermal contact conductance of the solder-copper interface by 70%. Thus, minimization of the solder thickness is recommended in practice.","","2020-09-10 18:11:40","2020-09-10 18:11:40","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\ME511\Luo_Chung_Effect Of The Thickness Of A Thermal Interface Material (Solder) On Heat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model assumes a heat source in contact with a larger cold plate which is in turn cooled with a convective heat transfer coefficient specified over the sink surface. Unlike existing models that mostly assume limiting boundary conditions, such as isothermal conditions, at the sink surface, the present solution allows one to accurately determine the constriction and spreading resistances in a plate with a full range of cooling conditions varying from an isothermal condition in one limit to a uniform heat-flux condition in the other limit. Dimensionless expressions in the form of infinite series are provided for computing the average and maximum constriction resistances as a function of relative contact size, plate thickness and the Biot number.

They include macroscale, microscale, and nanoscale surfaces, as well as multiscale (hybrid-scale), and hybrid-wettability techniques. Different enhancement methods are assessed in terms of underlying ﬂuid routing mechanisms and ability to achieve three distinct heat transfer goals: eliminating incipient boiling hysteresis, increasing nucleate boiling heat transfer coefﬁcient, and ameliorating critical heat ﬂux (CHF), especially for inert dielectric coolants that are both highly wetting and possess relatively poor thermophysical properties. While different enhancement scales are shown to provide different degrees of success in achieving the three goals, it is shown that both microscale and nanoscale surface features are susceptible to blockage, resulting in deterioration of the enhancement over time. This review also points to scarcity of sufﬁciently sized databases for a given enhancement scheme in terms of ﬂuid type, surface material, size, and orientation, enhancement shape, pattern, and scale, and operating pressure. This renders available ﬁndings less-than-adequate tools for design of practical cooling systems.","2019-01","2020-10-04 14:42:24","2020-10-04 14:42:25","2020-10-04 14:42:24","892-933","","","128","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\InterPACK\2019_International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer_Liang_Mudawar_Review of pool boiling enhancement by surface modification.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, biological templates have been used to demonstrate that wickability is the single factor dictating CHF on structured superhydrophilic surfaces. The ﬂexibility of biotemplating using the Tobacco mosaic virus has been leveraged to create surfaces with varying scales, morphologies, and roughness factors. Their wickabilities have been quantiﬁed via the wicked volume ﬂux, a phenomenological parameter analogous to the contact angle, and the role of wickability on CHF has been demonstrated using data from over three dozen individual surfaces. These results are repeatable and independent of the substrate material, surface fouling, structure material, morphology, and contact angle as well as the structure scale. An experimentally validated correlation for CHF has been reported on the basis of the dimensionless wickability. Additionally, the surfaces have achieved a CHF of 257 W/cm2 for water, representing the highest reported value to date for superhydrophilic surfaces. While the role of wickability on CHF has often been cited anecdotally, this work provides a quantitative measure of the phenomena and provides a framework for designing and optimizing coatings for further enhancement.","2014-09-23","2020-10-04 15:03:42","2020-10-04 15:03:42","2020-10-04 15:03:42","11225-11234","","37","30","","Langmuir","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\InterPACK\2014_Langmuir_Rahman et al_Role of Wickability on the Critical Heat Flux of Structured Superhydrophilic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Micro-/nano-structured surfaces have been demonstrated to signiﬁcantly enhance the critical heat ﬂux (CHF) during pool boiling, but there is no consensus on how to predict the structure-induced CHF enhancement. In this study, we develop an analytical model that takes into consideration key mechanisms that govern CHF during pool boiling on structured surfaces, namely, capillary wicking and evaporation of the liquid layer underneath the bubble. The model extends existing wicking-based CHF theories by introducing the competing evaporation mechanism. The model reveals a wicking-limited regime where CHF increases monotonically with the wicking ﬂux, and an evaporation-limited regime where additional increases in the wicking ﬂux do not signiﬁcantly affect CHF. The model predictions are shown to agree with experimental CHF data from the literature for boiling of water on surfaces structured with square micropillar arrays. A parametric study is performed for such micropillared surfaces and has identiﬁed the optimal structure based on the competition between wicking and evaporation, capillary pressure and viscous resistance, and conduction and liquid-vapor interfacial resistance.","2019-06","2020-10-04 15:04:42","2020-10-04 15:04:42","2020-10-04 15:04:42","373-382","","","136","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\InterPACK\2019_International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer_Hu et al_A coupled wicking and evaporation model for prediction of pool boiling critical.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four different wick geometries representing common wicks used in heat pipes, viz., wire mesh, rectangular grooves, sintered wicks and vertical microwires, are modeled and compared for evaporative performance. The solid–liquid combination considered is copper–water. Steady evaporation is modeled and the liquid–vapor interface shape is assumed to be static during evaporation. Liquid–vapor interface shapes in different geometries are obtained by solving the Young–Laplace equation using Surface Evolver. Mass, momentum and energy equations are solved numerically in the liquid domain, with the vapor assumed to be saturated. Evaporation at the interface is modeled by using heat and mass transfer rates obtained from kinetic theory. Thermocapillary convection due to non-isothermal conditions at the interface is modeled for all geometries and its role in heat transfer enhancement from the interface is quantiﬁed for both low and high superheats. More than 80% of the evaporation heat transfer is noted to occur from the thin-ﬁlm region of the liquid meniscus. The very small Capillary and Weber numbers resulting from the small ﬂuid velocities near the interface for low superheats validate the assumption of a static liquid meniscus shape during evaporation.

Among approaches for heat dissipation, thin-ﬁlm evaporation with micro/nanostructures has been one of the most promising approaches that can address future technological demand. The geometry and dimension of these micro/nanostructures directly govern the interfacial heat ﬂux. Here, through theoretical and experimental analysis, we ﬁnd that there is an optimal dimension of micro/nanostructures that maximizes the interfacial heat ﬂux by thin-ﬁlm evaporation. This optimal criterion is a consequence of two opposing phenomena: nonuniform evaporation ﬂux across a liquid meniscus (divergent mass ﬂux near the three-phase contact line) and the total liquid area exposed for evaporation. In vertical micro/nanostructures, the optimal width-to-spacing ratio is 1.27 for square pillars and 1.5 for wires (e.g., nanowires). This general criterion is independent of the solid material and the thermophysical properties of the cooling liquid. At the optimal width-to-spacing ratio, as the density of the pillars increases (i.e., smaller pillar’s dimension), the interfacial heat ﬂux increases. This study provides a direction for rational development of micro/nanostructures for thin-ﬁlm evaporation and paves the path for development of high-performance thermal management systems.","2016-04-28","2020-10-04 15:13:10","2020-10-04 15:13:11","2020-10-04 15:13:10","8742-8750","","16","120","","J.

The desired characteristics of wick microstructures are high permeability, high wicking capability and large extended meniscus area that sustains thin-ﬁlm evaporation. Choices of scale and porosity of wick structures lead to trade-offs between the desired characteristics. In the present work, models are developed to predict the capillary pressure, permeability and thin-ﬁlm evaporation rates of various micropillared geometries. Novel wicking geometries such as conical and pyramidal pillars on a surface are proposed which provide high permeability, good thermal contact with the substrate and large thin-ﬁlm evaporation rates. A comparison between three different micropillared geometries – cylindrical, conical and pyramidal – is presented and compared to the performance of conventional sintered particle wicks. The employment of micropillared wick structure leads to a 10-fold enhancement in the maximum heat transport capability of the device.

Evaporation cooling for electronics systems has been considered one of the most promising approaches for meeting the demands of high-powered technologies by taking advantage of their latent heat. Integrating microscale or nanoscale features into two-phase microﬂuidic cooling systems such as porous media can dramatically increase the area of liquid-vapor interfaces where phonons translate thermal energy to ﬂuid enthalpy. To achieve this performance jump, it is essential to understand how the engineered features improve evaporative heat transfer performance. In this study, we investigate thin-ﬁlm evaporation performance within crystalline pore surfaces by employing simulation models that examine solid-liquid contact lines and liquid-vapor interfaces. The simulation models compute detailed performance parameters including phase volume fraction, temperature, pressure proﬁle, and evaporative mass ﬂux as a function of location, allowing us to calculate local heat transfer performance parameters. Based on local heat transfer performances, we identify thin-ﬁlm regions and quantify their fractions to the overall evaporation performance. Area-averaged heat transfer coefﬁcients are compared to identify the morphological effects of varying pore diameters and surface wettability. Insights from this parametric study will allow us to understand how evaporative heat transfer is related to the structural details of porous media and assist us to determine guidelines for the design of evaporating surfaces in modern electronics cooling.","2018-07","2020-10-04 15:38:43","2020-10-04 15:38:43","2020-10-04 15:38:43","59-68","","","122","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\InterPACK\2018_International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer_Montazeri et al_Microscopic analysis of thin-film evaporation on spherical pore surfaces.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using multilevel modulated wicks, i.e., monolayer, columnar, and mushroom post wicks, we control the liquid and vapor ﬂow for eﬃcient phase separation, thereby improving the CHF and HTC. The wicks are fabricated using multi-step sintering process using 200 μm copper particles, and the pool boiling uses n-pentane at ambient pressure. The monolayer wicks without and with the mushroom post structure provide 20% and 87% CHF enhancements, respectively, compared to the plain surface. It is found that the CHF enhancement of the mushroom wick is attributed to its pitch distance, 3.5 mm, which eﬀectively reduce the hydrodynamic instability (Rayleigh-Taylor) wavelength. The further reduction of the pitch distance, 1 mm, results in the 250% CHF improvement in agreement with the theory. The columnar and mushroom posts with monolayer increase HTC by tenfold, compared to the plain surface, due to the reduced conduction path through the thin monolayer wick under the controlled vapor region using the columnar and mushroom post wick (vapor chamber-like environment in pool boiling).

A Finite Element-based conjugate heat transfer model is developed, validated experimentally and used to determine the optimal minichannel width and number of minichannels for a case with a uniform heat ﬂux of 100 W/cm2. The optimisation process uses a 30 point Optimal Latin Hypercubes Design of Experiments, generated from a permutation genetic algorithm, and accurate metamodels built using a Moving Least Square approach. A Pareto front is then constructed to enable the compromises available between designs with a low pressure drop and those with low thermal resistance to be explored and an appropriate minichannel width and number of minichannels to be chosen. These parameters are then used within conjugate heat transfer models of a serpentine MCHS with silicon, silicon carbide, diamond and graphene heat spreaders placed above a GaN HEMT heating source of area 4.8 × 0.8 mm2, generating 1823 W/ cm2. A nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) layer with thickness of 2 µm is mounted on the top surface of the GaN HEMT to function as a heat spreader to mitigate the hot spots.

A simple combination of cleanroom microfabricated silicon and laser-cutting of plastics was employed to make a microchannel heat sink that simultaneously cools down 20 active devices (hotspots) of a power electronic converter. By flowing liquid close to the active devices through narrow microchannels, we show that the power requirements of the pump can be minimized, resulting in a compact cooling system that allows integration with small and energy-efficient micropumps. The manifold microchannel heatsink is demonstrated on a ultra-high power density magnetic-less 10x-step-up DC/DC converter resulting in a smaller volume and higher cooling capability than conventional heat sinks. The converter was tested up to an output power of 1.2 kW, with an overall efficiency of 96%, and an average temperature rise of only 12.6 °C.

Therefore, thermal control becomes important, but the limitations on mass and electrical power require new approaches. Possible solutions to actively vary the heat rejection of the satellite in response to variations in the thermal load and environmental condition are the use of a variable emissivity coating (VEC), micro-machined shutters and louvers, or thermal switches. An elegant way to radiate heat is to switch the thermal contact between the emitting surface and the radiator electrostatically. This paper describes the design and fabrication of an active radiator for satellite thermal control based on such a micro electromechanical (MEMS) thermal switch. The switch operates by electrostatically moving a high emissivity surface layer in and out of contact with the radiator. The electromechanical model and material considerations for the thermal design of the MEMS device are discussed. The design utilizes a highly thermal conductive gold membrane supported by low-conductance SU-8 posts. The fabrication process is described.

The steady-state 3DMark - Slingshot Extreme benchmark score increased from 3401 to 3823 resulting in a 12.4% increase in steady-state system performance. The enhanced device performance was linked with material properties by means of steady-state heat flow and thickness testing for through-plane thermal conductivity of insulation, and thermal diffusivity testing for in-plane thermal conductivity of graphite. In-plane conductivity of graphite was validated experimentally in a steady-state heat spreading test where 100 μm foils of high-performance graphite measured 30% higher spreading capacity than 100 μm foils of synthetic and natural graphite.","2020-03","2020-11-27 02:38:48","2020-11-27 02:38:48","","82-90","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\ME511\2020_Warren et al_Increased System Performance and Reduced Surface Touch (Skin) Temperature in.pdf; C:\Users\bonga\Zotero\storage\SV3HE7WW\9142840.html","","","Thermal resistance; 3DMark - Slingshot Extreme; ambient temperature; axisymmetric conduction model; benchmark score; composite; composite materials; Conductivity; electronics packaging; Google Pixel 3XL (Pixel); graphite; Graphite; graphite foils; heat spreader; heat transfer; Heating systems; high-performance graphite; hot spot; in-plane thermal conductivity; insulation; Insulation; insulation sheets; junction temperature; maximum junction temperature; mobile electronics; mobile handsets; natural graphite; reduced surface touch temperature; single-component thermal solutions; size 100.0 mum; skin temperatures; steady-state; steady-state 3DMark-Slingshot extreme benchmark score; steady-state heat flow; steady-state surface touch temperatures; surface temperature reductions; surface touch (skin) temperature; system on chip (SoC); system performance; Temperature measurement; thermal analysis; thermal conductivity; Thermal conductivity; thermal diffusion; thermal diffusivity; thermal diffusivity testin; thermal diffusivity testing; thermal insulation; thermal stress testing; thermal stresses; thermally stressed Google Pixel 3XL; thickness; thickness testing; through-plane thermal conductivity; ultra-high spreading capacity; ultra-low thermal conductivity; ultrahigh spreading capacity; ultralow thermal conductivity; user comfort; user safety","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 36th Semiconductor Thermal Measurement, Modeling Management Symposium (SEMI-THERM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A gap between the two silicon substrates is ﬁlled with either air at 760 Torr, air at of 0.5 Torr or xenon at 760 Torr.

The thermal conductivity change roots from the segmental rotations along the polymer chains, which introduce alongchain morphology disorder that signiﬁcantly interrupts phonon transport along the molecular chains. This phase transition, which can be regulated by temperature, strain, or their combinations, is found to be fully reversible in the polyethylene nanoﬁbers and can happen at a narrow temperature window. The phase change temperature can be further tuned by engineering the diameters of the nanoﬁbers, making such a thermal conductivity regulation scheme adaptable to diﬀerent application needs.

The LBA was built up on the D2Q9 model and the single relaxation time method called the lattice-BGK method. The ®nite-volume code was based on an incompressible Navier± Stokes solver for arbitrary non-orthogonal, body-®tted grids. Both numerical methods are of second-order accuracy in space and time. Accurate computations were carried out on grids with dierent resolutions. The results of both methods were evaluated and compared in detail.

For this purpose, the simulation is performed by using the projection method combined with a Chebyshev collocation spectral method. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are formulated in terms of the primitive variables, velocity and pressure. The time integration of the spectrally discretized, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is performed by a secondorder mixed explicit/implicit time integration scheme. This scheme is a combination of the Crank-Nicolson scheme operating on the diffusive terms and a second-order AdamsBashforth scheme acting on the advective terms. The projection method is used to split the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in two decoupled problems: the Burgers equation to predict an intermediate velocity field and the Poisson equation for the pressure, which is used to correct the intermediate velocity field and satisfy the continuity equation. Numerical simulations for flows inside a two-dimensional regularized square driven cavity for Reynolds numbers up to 10000 and over a backward-facing step for Reynolds numbers up to 875 are presented and compared with numerical results previously published, where good agreement is demonstrated.","2007-09","2020-12-11 23:07:00","2020-12-11 23:07:00","2020-12-11 23:07:00","","","3","29","","J.

Increasing surface roughness using micro/ nanostructures can improve capillary action to enhance wicking. However, reducing the structure length scale can also result in signiﬁcant viscous forces to impede wicking. In this work, we demonstrate enhanced wicking dynamics by using nanostructures with three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical features to increase the surface area while mitigating the obstruction of liquid ﬂow. The proposed structures were engineered using a combination of interference lithography and hydrothermal synthesis of ZnO nanowires, where structures at two length scales were independently designed to control wicking behavior. The fabricated hierarchical 3D structures were tested for water and ethanol wicking properties, demonstrating improved wicking dynamics with intermediate nanowire lengths. The experimental data agree with the derived ﬂuid model based on the balance of capillary and vicious forces. The hierarchical wicking structures can be potentially used in applications in water harvesting surfaces, microﬂuidics, and integrated heat exchangers.","2016-08-16","2020-12-21 19:58:25","2020-12-21 19:58:32","2020-12-21 19:58:25","8029-8033","","32","32","","Langmuir","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\Contact Line Dynamics\2016_Langmuir_Wang et al_Wicking Enhancement in Three-Dimensional Hierarchical Nanostructures.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High subcooling was achieved by pre-cooling the working ﬂuid using a secondary low-temperature refrigeration system. The high subcooling greatly reduced both bubble departure diameter and void fraction, and precluded ﬂow pattern transitions beyond the bubbly regime. CHF was triggered by vapor blanket formation along the micro-channel walls despite the presence of abundant core liquid, which is consistent with the mechanism of Departure from Nucleate Boiling (DNB). CHF increased with increasing mass velocity and/or subcooling and decreasing hydraulic diameter for a given total mass ﬂow rate. A pre-mature type of CHF was caused by vapor backﬂow into the heat sink’s inlet plenum at low mass velocities and small inlet subcoolings, and was associated with signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations in inlet and outlet pressure, as well as wall temperature. A systematic technique is developed to modify existing CHF correlations to more accurately account for features unique to micro-channel heat sinks, including rectangular cross-section, three-sided heating, and ﬂow interaction between micro-channels. This technique is shown to be successful at correlating micro-channel heat sink data corresponding to different hydraulic diameters, mass velocities and inlet temperatures. Ó 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Template sintering is used to enlarge the “necks”, or hydraulic vias, that bridge adjacent IO pores of diameters from 0.6 to 2.1 µm.

The test surfaces ranged from a polished surface (Ra between 0.027 μm and 0.038 μm) to electrical discharge machined (EDM) surfaces with a roughness (Ra) ranging from 1.08 μm to 10.0 μm. Different trends were observed in the heat transfer coefficient with respect to the surface roughness between the two fluids on the same set of surfaces. For FC-77, the heat transfer coefficient was found to continually increase with increasing roughness. For water, on the other hand, EDM surfaces of intermediate roughness displayed similar heat transfer coefficients that were higher than for the polished surface, while the roughest surface showed the highest heat transfer coefficients. The heat transfer coefficients were more strongly influenced by surface roughness with FC-77 than with water. For FC-77, the roughest surface produced 210% higher heat transfer coefficients than the polished surface while for water, a more modest 100% enhancement was measured between the same set of surfaces. Although the results highlight the inadequacy of characterizing nucleate pool boiling data using Ra, the observed effect of roughness was correlated using h∝Ram as has been done in several prior studies.

Our method of assessing drug target similarity correlated to existing anatomical therapeutic chemical code-based methods with a Pearson correlation coefﬁcient of 0.9311. The indirect relationships ranking method achieved a signiﬁcant mean average precision score of top 100 most common diseases. We also conﬁrmed the suitability of candidates identiﬁed for repurposing as anticancer drugs by conducting a manual review of the literature and the clinical trials. Eventually, for visualization and enrichment of huge amount of repurposed drug information, a chord diagram was demonstrated to rapidly identify two novel indications for further biological evaluations.","2016-04-25","2021-05-31 17:52:00","2021-05-31 17:52:00","2021-05-31 17:52:00","bbw030","","","","","Brief Bioinform","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\SMC Challenge\2016_Brief Bioinform_Yang et al_Literature-based discovery of new candidates for drug repurposing.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, a new idea, solid surface is charged with surface charges, is proposed to suppress the formation of vapor layer and prevent the liquid ﬁlm detachment. To examine the effectiveness of the idea, the boiling behaviors of water ﬁlms on gold (1 0 0) surfaces with various wettability conditions as well as with or without surface charges are investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that the electric ﬁeld induced by the surface charges leads to an increased attractive interaction between the water ﬁlm and the gold surface. Meanwhile, it is very interesting that a cone-shaped liquid column moves upward from the free surface of the water ﬁlm due to the directional arrangement of water molecules along the electric ﬁeld direction, which helps the nucleation bubble to break through the water ﬁlm. Thus, the formation of vapor layer is suppressed and the water ﬁlm detachment is never observed during the whole phase-change process of water ﬁlm. The results also reveal that the electric ﬁeld signiﬁcantly increases the collision rate between water molecules and gold atoms, and hence enhances heat transfer from the gold surface to the water ﬁlm.","2017-06","2021-06-06 01:27:23","2021-06-06 01:27:25","2021-06-06 01:27:23","410-416","","","109","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\BOiling\ThinFilmBoilingMD\2017_International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer_Wang et al_Enhancement of boiling heat transfer of thin water film on an electrified solid.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The molecular system is comprised of the liquid and vapor argon as well as a copper wall. The nanostructures have spherical shape with uniform diameters while the thickness of liquid film is constant. The effects of transvers and longitudinal distances as well as the diameter of nanoparticles are analyzed. The simulation is started from an initial configuration for three phases (liquid argon, vapor argon and solid wall); after equilibrating the system at 90 K, the wall is heated suddenly to a higher temperature that is well beyond the critical temperature of argon. Two different superheat degrees are selected: a moderately high temperature of 170 K for normal evaporation and much higher temperature 290 K for explosive boiling. By monitoring the space and time dependences of temperature and density as well as net evaporation rate, the normal and explosive boiling process on a flat surface with and without nanostructures are investigated. The results show that the nanostructure has significant effect on evaporation/boiling of thin film. The degrees of superheat and size of nanoparticles have significant effects on the trajectories of particles and net evaporation rate. For the cases with nanostructure, liquid responds very quickly and the number of evaporation molecules increases with increasing the size of particles from 1 to 2 nm while it decreases for d = 3 nm.","2013-12-01","2021-06-06 01:31:46","2021-06-07 01:08:49","2021-06-06 01:31:46","121503","","12","135","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\BOiling\ThinFilmBoilingMD\2013_Reza Seyf_Zhang_Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Normal and Explosive Boiling on Nanostructured.pdf","","1/10; 0/4; 1/3; 0/2; 0/1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High-throughput screening and computer-aided drug discovery/design are the two main drug discovery methods for now, which have successfully discovered a series of drugs. However, development of new drugs is still an extremely time-consuming and expensive process. Biomedical literature contains important clues for the identification of potential treatments. It could support experts in biomedicine on their way towards new discoveries. Methods: Here, we propose a biomedical knowledge graph-based drug discovery method called SemaTyP, which discovers candidate drugs for diseases by mining published biomedical literature. We first construct a biomedical knowledge graph with the relations extracted from biomedical abstracts, then a logistic regression model is trained by learning the semantic types of paths of known drug therapies’ existing in the biomedical knowledge graph, finally the learned model is used to discover drug therapies for new diseases. Results: The experimental results show that our method could not only effectively discover new drug therapies for new diseases, but also could provide the potential mechanism of action of the candidate drugs.

The interaction network of human IFN-γ (Gene symbol: IFNG) and its vaccine-specific subnetwork were automatically extracted using abstracts from all articles in PubMed. Four network centrality metrics were further calculated to rank the genes in the constructed networks. The resulting generic IFNG network contains 1060 genes and 26313 interactions among these genes. The vaccine-specific subnetwork contains 102 genes and 154 interactions. Fifty six genes such as TNF, NFKB1, IL2, IL6, and MAPK8 were ranked among the top 25 by at least one of the centrality methods in one or both networks. Gene enrichment analysis indicated that these genes were classified in various immune mechanisms such as response to extracellular stimulus, lymphocyte activation, and regulation of apoptosis.

In this paper, a newly developed 3D thermal Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), incorporating double distribution functions (DDF), pseudo-potential model and equation of state (EOS) of a real gas, is used to simulate dynamic evaporation along the vapor/liquid interface and boiling in the liquid thin ﬁlm on a microstructured surface consisting of micro pillars. Simulations are conducted under constant heat ﬂuxes for four solid hydrophilic surfaces with contact angles of 10°, 23°, 37° and 63° respectively. Residual liquid volume, two-phase interface morphology, wall temperature distribution, as well as effective heat transfer coefﬁcient and CHF under different conditions are discussed in details. With increasing heat ﬂux, it is found that the liquid thin ﬁlm recedes gradually into the wick structure, with the lowest liquid level at the center of the heating area, to maintain a continuous liquid supply via capillary pumping. The receding of the liquid thin ﬁlm can normally enhance evaporation heat transfer because it not only reduces the thermal conduction resistance of liquid thin ﬁlms, but also elongates the evaporating liquid meniscus along the height direction of micro pillars. For larger contact angles of 37° and 63° for example, dry-out initiates from the heating center at a sufﬁciently high heat ﬂux, leading to serious deterioration of heat transfer with expansion of the dry-out area. However, for smaller contact angle of 10° and 23°, ﬁxed and periodical bubble nucleation appears sequentially before dry-out heat ﬂux. At small heat ﬂuxes, there is no obvious difference in effective heat transfer coefﬁcient for four hydrophilic surfaces. On the other hand, considerable increase of effective heat transfer coefﬁcient can be obtained at higher heat ﬂux on a stronger hydrophilic surface because of the receding of the liquid ﬁlm can sustain a higher dry-out heat ﬂux, or CHF.","2015-07","2021-06-06 20:01:51","2021-06-06 20:01:51","2021-06-06 20:01:51","629-638","","","86","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\BOiling\ThinFilmBoilingMD\2015_International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer_Zhang et al_Simulation of liquid thin film evaporation and boiling on a heated hydrophilic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Template sintering is used to enlarge the “necks”, or hydraulic vias, that bridge adjacent IO pores of diameters from 0.6 to 2.1 µm.

The molecular system was comprised of the following: solid platinum wall, liquid argon, and argon vapor. A few layers of the liquid argon were placed on the nanoposts decorated solid surface. The nanoposts height was varied keeping the liquid film thickness constant to capture three scenarios: (i) liquid-film thickness is higher than the height of the nanoposts, (ii) liquid-film and nanoposts are of same height, and (iii) liquid-film thickness is less than the height of the nanoposts. The rest of the simulation box was filled with argon vapor. The simulation was started from its initial configuration, and once the equilibrium of the three phase system was established, the wall was suddenly heated to a higher temperature which resembles an ultrafast laser heating. Two different jump temperatures were selected: a few degrees above the boiling point to initiate normal evaporation and far above the critical point to initiate explosive boiling. Simulation results indicate nanostructures play a significant role in both cases: Argon responds very quickly for the nanostructured surface, the transition from liquid to vapor becomes more gradual, and the evaporation rate increases with the nanoposts height.","2011-11-01","2021-06-07 01:31:45","2021-06-07 15:47:46","2021-06-07 01:31:45","445-451","","2","105","","Appl.

The molecular system consists of liquid and vapor argon and solid platinum wall. The nanostructures which reside on top of the solid wall have shape of rectangular block. The solid–liquid interfacial wettability, in other words whether the solid surface is hydrophilic or hydrophobic, has been altered for different cases to examine its effect on boiling phenomena. The initial configuration of the simulation domain comprises a three-phase system (solid platinum, liquid argon, and vapor argon), which was equilibrated at 90 K. After equilibrium period, the wall temperature was suddenly increased from 90 K to 250 K which is far above the critical point of argon and this initiates rapid or explosive boiling. The spatial and temporal variation of temperature and density as well as the variation of system pressure with respect to time were closely monitored for each case. The heat flux normal to the solid surface was also calculated to illustrate the effectiveness of heat transfer for different cases of wetting conditions of solid surface. The results show that the wetting condition of surface has significant effect on explosive boiling of the thin liquid film. The surface with higher wettability (hydrophilic) provides more favorable conditions for boiling than the low-wetting surface (hydrophobic), and therefore, the liquid argon responds quickly and shifts from liquid to vapor phase faster in the case of hydrophilic surface. The heat transfer rate is also much higher in the case of hydrophilic surface.","2016-03-10","2021-06-07 01:44:02","2021-06-07 01:44:02","2021-06-07 01:44:02","","","010904","138","","Journal of Electronic Packaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\BOiling\ThinFilmBoilingMD\2016_Journal of Electronic Packaging_Shavik et al_Molecular Dynamics Study on Explosive Boiling of Thin Liquid Argon Film on.pdf; C:\Users\bonga\Zotero\storage\IMP4CX5Z\384604.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, macroscopic observations cannot fully clarify the fundamental mechanisms in a nano-scale regime. To understand the mechanism of sub-cooled boiling on the nano-structured surface in nano-scale view, sub-cooled boiling process and its interaction with different nano-structured configurations (cuboid and finger) at different wall superheated temperatures are computed with molecular dynamics. Nanobubbles of gas vapor are observed to be generated and condensed rapidly for nano-scale sub-cooled boiling. With the increasing of wall superheat, the aggregation and coalescence of adjacent nano bubbles become intense, resulting in the formation of a vapor layer separating the heated wall from cooled water liquid. It is found that nano bubbles are easy to be coalesced in horizontal directions in the case of a plain surface, resulting in an earlier formation of the vapor layer, while in the cases of nano-structured surfaces, a kind of nano-scale vertical convection induced by nano cavity is observed, which delays the vapor layer formation and intensifies the initial disturbance causing hydrodynamic instability of the vapor layer significantly. This finding clarifies the difference of heat transfer capacity between the case of nano-structured surfaces and the case of plain surfaces. In view of heat transfer efficiency, cases with nano-structured surfaces manifest a prominent increase of heat flux and critical heat flux values with the increase of wall superheat as compared with cases of plain surfaces, which is in good agreement with available macroscopical experimental results. Therefore, the nano-cavity-induced nano-scale vertical convection mechanism can give a more fundamental explanation to those macroscopic observations.","2016-09-01","2021-06-07 02:00:30","2021-06-07 17:49:15","2021-06-07 02:00:30","276-286","","","100","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\BOiling\ThinFilmBoilingMD\2016_International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer_Wang et al_MD simulation on nano-scale heat transfer mechanism of sub-cooled boiling on.pdf; C:\Users\bonga\Zotero\storage\E2NIZ292\S0017931015315180.html","","5.5/10","Heat transfer; Micro/nano-structures; Molecular dynamics simulation; Sub-cooled boiling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Topological and microstructural details of the wick material embedded in a heat pipe help determine its thermal performance. A good understanding of pore-scale transport phenomena is crucial to enhancing heat pipe performance. In this study, pore-scale analysis of thin-film evaporation through sintered copper wicks is performed. X-ray microtomography is employed to generate geometrically faithful, feature-preserving meshes. Commercial sintered wicks with particle sizes in the range of 45–60μm, 106–150μm and 250–355μm and with approximately 61% porosity are considered. The capillary pressure, characteristic pore radius, percentage thin film area and evaporative mass and heat fluxes are computed using a volume of fluid (VOF) approach. Two different solution strategies are employed to stabilize the numerical solution and to improve convergence. After verifying that these strategies yield the correct solution, the VOF model is used to obtain static meniscus shapes in the pore space of the sintered wick samples. The meniscus shape is then held fixed and steady-state, thin-film evaporation analysis is performed. Liquid–vapor phase change heat transfer is modeled using a modified Schrage equation. Based on the present analysis, the best performing sample (particle size range) is identified along with the optimum contact angle.","2013-06-01","2021-06-08 19:02:28","2021-06-08 19:02:28","2021-06-08 19:02:28","729-741","","","61","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\Evaporation paper\2013_International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer_Bodla et al_Evaporation analysis in sintered wick microstructures2.pdf; C:\Users\bonga\Zotero\storage\7THGT4Q8\S0017931013001531.html","","","Capillary pressure; Evaporation heat transfer; Heat pipe; Sintered powder wick; Thin-film evaporation; X-ray microtomography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite tremendous progress in the past few years, efficient solar steam generation and desalination can only be achieved for rather limited water quantity with the assistance of concentrators and thermal insulation, not feasible for large-scale applications. The fundamental paradox is that the conventional design of direct absorber−bulk water contact ensures efficient energy transfer and water supply but also has intrinsic thermal loss through bulk water. Here, enabled by a confined 2D water path, we report an efficient (80% under one-sun illumination) and effective (four orders salinity decrement) solar desalination device. More strikingly, because of minimized heat loss, high efficiency of solar desalination is independent of the water quantity and can be maintained without thermal insulation of the container. A foldable graphene oxide film, fabricated by a scalable process, serves as efficient solar absorbers (>94%), vapor channels, and thermal insulators. With unique structure designs fabricated by scalable processes and high and stable efficiency achieved under normal solar illumination independent of water quantity without any supporting systems, our device represents a concrete step for solar desalination to emerge as a complementary portable and personalized clean water solution.","2016-12-06","2021-06-08 22:06:18","2021-06-08 22:06:18","2021-06-08 22:06:18","13953-13958","","49","113","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","©  . http://www.pnas.org/site/misc/userlicense.xhtml","","","","www.pnas.org","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Physical Sciences PMID: 27872280","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\Evaporation paper\2016_PNAS_Li et al_Graphene oxide-based efficient and scalable solar desalination under one sun.pdf; ; C:\Users\bonga\Zotero\storage\3HXDAT9W\13953.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27872280","","2D water path; graphene oxide; heat localization; solar desalination; solar steam","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Polypharmacy side effects emerge because of drug–drug interactions, in which activity of one drug may change, favorably or unfavorably, if taken with another drug.

The thermal field underneath a bubble during the boiling of FC-72 was measured with a spatial resolution of 22--40μm. The time period of activation, area of influence, and magnitude of three different mechanisms of heat transfer active at the nucleation site were determined. These mechanisms consisted of: (1) microlayer evaporation following the rapid bubble expansion, (2) transient conduction due to rewetting of the surface during bubble departure, and (3) microconvection in the region external to the bubble/surface contact area. The area of influence of the transient conduction mechanism was found to be limited to the bubble/surface contact area, with most of the heat transfer occurring prior to the bubble detachment from the surface. The microconvection heat transfer mechanism was localized primarily outside the contact area and was found to be steady in nature. All three mechanisms of heat transfer were found to make significant contributions to the total surface heat transfer.

The experimental findings on the nature of different heat transfer mechanisms involved in the nucleation process were discussed in part I. In this paper, the experimental results are compared with the existing boiling models. The boiling models based on dominance of a single mechanism of heat transfer did not match the experimental results. However, the Rohsenow model was found to closely predict the heat transfer through the microconvection mechanism that is primarily active outside the bubble/surface contact area. An existing transient conduction model was modified to predict the surface heat transfer during the rewetting process (i.e. transient conduction mechanism). This model takes into account the gradual rewetting of the surface during the transient conduction process rather than a simple sudden surface coverage assumption commonly used in the boiling literature. The initial superheat energy of the microlayer (i.e. microlayer sensible energy) was accurately calculated and found to significantly contribute in microlayer evaporation. This even exceeded the direct wall heat transfer to microlayer at high surface superheat temperatures. A composite model was introduced that closely matches our experimental results. It incorporates models for three mechanisms of heat transfer including microlayer evaporation, transient conduction, microconvection, as well as their influence area and activation time. The significance of this development is that, for the first time, all submodels of the composite correlation were independently verified using experimental results.","2009-02-01","2021-06-10 19:16:23","2021-06-10 19:16:23","2021-06-10 19:16:23","1295-1303","","5","52","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","Physical mechanisms of heat transfer during single bubble nucleate boiling of FC-72 under saturation conditions.

However, the reported results range widely from a decline to improvements in performance depending on the test conditions and fluid properties, without a consensus on the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed behavior. This gap in knowledge stems from a lack of understanding of the physics of surface structures interactions with microscale heat and mass transfer events involved in the microchannel flow boiling process. Here, using a novel measurement technique, the heat and mass transfer process is analyzed within surface structures with unprecedented detail. The local heat flux and dryout time scale are measured as the liquid wicks through surface structures and evaporates. The physics governing heat transfer enhancement on textured surfaces is explained by a deterministic model that involves three key parameters: the drying time scale of the liquid film wicking into the surface structures (τd), the heating length scale of the liquid film (δH) and the area fraction of the evaporating liquid film (Ar). It is shown that the model accurately predicts the optimum spacing between surface structures (i.e. pillars fabricated on the microchannel wall) in boiling of two fluids FC-72 and water with fundamentally different wicking characteristics.","2017-03-17","2021-06-10 19:26:51","2021-06-10 19:26:51","2021-06-10 19:26:51","44745","","1","7","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2017 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","C:\Users\bonga\Zotero\storage\LRVU3HH5\srep44745.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But, a mechanism to manipulate dynamics of the vapor and liquid interactions above the boiling surface as a means of enhancing CHF has not been proposed. Here, a new approach is implemented to limit the vapor phase lateral expansion over the heat transfer surface and actively control the surface wetted area fraction, known to decline monotonically with increasing heat flux. This new degree of freedom has enabled reaching unprecedented CHF levels and revealed new details about the physics of CHF. The impact of wickability, effective heat transfer area, and liquid pressure on CHF is precisely quantified. Test results show that, when rewetting is facilitated, the CHF increases linearly with the effective surface heat transfer area. A maximum CHF of 1.8 kW/cm2 was achieved on a copper structure with the highest surface area among all tested surfaces. A model developed based on the experimental data suggests that the thermal conductivity of the surface structures ultimately limits the CHF; and a maximum CHF of 7–8 kW/cm2 may be achieved using diamond surface structures.","2017-07-12","2021-06-10 19:27:33","2021-06-10 19:27:33","2021-06-10 19:27:33","5184","","1","7","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2017 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\BOiling\HTC\2017_Sci Rep_Fazeli_Moghaddam_A New Paradigm for Understanding and Enhancing the Critical Heat Flux (CHF).pdf; C:\Users\bonga\Zotero\storage\ISY82GAU\s41598-017-05036-2.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A set of experiments is designed with thirteen prepared samples: twelve with a microstructured surface, and one with a bare surface. The samples are fabricated using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) techniques. The samples are tested using pool boiling experiments in saturated and atmospheric pressure conditions. The experimental results show that BHT increases with the surface roughness, defined as the ratio of the rough surface area to the projected area, but this enhancement gradually slows. The heat transfer coefficient of the structured surface is more than 300% that of the bare surface. The increase in the heating surface area due to the roughness ratio improves nucleate BHT due to the enhancement of convective heat transfer. The structured surface shows a 350% improvement in CHF over the bare surface. However, through analysis of the capillary flow rate on the structured surface, a critical gap size that limits the CHF is found. The critical gap size is discussed analytically and compared with experimental data. Designs for optimal boiling performance are proposed by studying the role of microstructured surfaces in both BHT and CHF.","2015-12-01","2021-06-10 22:03:06","2021-06-10 22:03:06","2021-06-10 22:03:05","1140-1147","","","91","","International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\BOiling\HTC\2015_International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer_Kim et al_Boiling heat transfer and critical heat flux evaluation of the pool boiling on.pdf; C:\Users\bonga\Zotero\storage\FVXJMCTV\S0017931015008388.html","","","Critical heat flux; Boiling heat transfer; Microstructure surface","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The individual bubble departure diameter and energy transfer were larger with low subcooling but the departure frequency increased at high subcooling, resulting in higher overall heat transfer. The bubble growth for both subcoolings was primarily due to energy transfer from the superheated liquid layer-relatively little was due to wall heat transfer during the bubble growth process. Oscillating bubbles and sliding bubbles were also observed in highly subcooled boiling. Transient conduction and/or microconvection was the dominant heat transfer mechanism in the above cases.

A brief historical perspective and primary findings are presented in this article. Though impressive gains have been made in enhancement of boiling heat transport, there still remain several unknowns such as the mechanisms that affect critical heat flux and optimization of surfaces for boiling heat transport. The promise of improved spatial resolution of optical techniques should improve knowledge of near-surface mechanisms. Standardization of experimental test sections and procedures has emerged as a critical issue that needs to be addressed immediately.","2014-07-03","2021-06-10 23:27:42","2021-06-10 23:27:42","2021-06-10 23:27:42","197-222","","3","18","","","Boiling Augmentation with Micro/Nanostructured Surfaces","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/15567265.2014.923074","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\BOiling\HTC\2014_Bhavnani et al_Boiling Augmentation with Micro-Nanostructured Surfaces.pdf; C:\Users\bonga\Zotero\storage\U3EC5REU\15567265.2014.html","","","boiling; micro- and nano-structured surfaces; research outlook article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
