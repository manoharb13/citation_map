In this work, a new enhancement mechanism based on the early evaporation of the microlayer is discovered and validated. The microlayer is a thin liquid ﬁlm present at the base of a vapor bubble. The presence of microridges on the silicon dioxide surface partitions the microlayer and disconnects it from the bulk liquid, causing it to evaporate sooner, thus leading to increase in the bubble growth rate, heat transfer, departure frequency, and critical heat ﬂux (CHF). Compared to a plain surface, an ∼120% enhancement in CHF is obtained with only an ∼18% increase in surface area. A CHF enhancement map is developed on the basis of the ridge height and spacing, resulting in three regions of full, partial, and no enhancement. The new mechanism is validated by comparing the growth rate of a laser-created vapor bubble on a ridgestructured surface and a plain surface, and the corresponding prediction of the CHF enhancement is found to be in good agreement with the experimental boiling data. This discovery opens up a new ﬁeld of CHF enhancement and can potentially be coupled with existing techniques to further push the limits of boiling heat transfer.","2016-10-25","2020-05-16 18:52:31","2020-05-16 18:52:31","2020-05-16 18:52:31","10808-10814","","42","32","","Langmuir","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\BOiling\surface_modifications\2016_Langmuir_Zou et al_Early Evaporation of Microlayer for Boiling Heat Transfer Enhancement.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using multilevel modulated wicks, i.e., monolayer, columnar, and mushroom post wicks, we control the liquid and vapor ﬂow for eﬃcient phase separation, thereby improving the CHF and HTC. The wicks are fabricated using multi-step sintering process using 200 μm copper particles, and the pool boiling uses n-pentane at ambient pressure. The monolayer wicks without and with the mushroom post structure provide 20% and 87% CHF enhancements, respectively, compared to the plain surface. It is found that the CHF enhancement of the mushroom wick is attributed to its pitch distance, 3.5 mm, which eﬀectively reduce the hydrodynamic instability (Rayleigh-Taylor) wavelength. The further reduction of the pitch distance, 1 mm, results in the 250% CHF improvement in agreement with the theory. The columnar and mushroom posts with monolayer increase HTC by tenfold, compared to the plain surface, due to the reduced conduction path through the thin monolayer wick under the controlled vapor region using the columnar and mushroom post wick (vapor chamber-like environment in pool boiling). The multilevel wick design provides fundamental insights into simultaneous CHF and HTC enhancements with potential use in advanced thermal management systems.","2018-06","2020-10-07 18:13:16","2020-10-07 18:13:16","2020-10-07 18:13:16","268-276","","","137","","Applied Thermal Engineering","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\BOiling\surface_modifications\2018_Applied Thermal Engineering_Nasersharifi et al_Pool-boiling enhancement using multilevel modulated wick.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The test surfaces ranged from a polished surface (Ra between 0.027 μm and 0.038 μm) to electrical discharge machined (EDM) surfaces with a roughness (Ra) ranging from 1.08 μm to 10.0 μm. Different trends were observed in the heat transfer coefficient with respect to the surface roughness between the two fluids on the same set of surfaces. For FC-77, the heat transfer coefficient was found to continually increase with increasing roughness. For water, on the other hand, EDM surfaces of intermediate roughness displayed similar heat transfer coefficients that were higher than for the polished surface, while the roughest surface showed the highest heat transfer coefficients. The heat transfer coefficients were more strongly influenced by surface roughness with FC-77 than with water. For FC-77, the roughest surface produced 210% higher heat transfer coefficients than the polished surface while for water, a more modest 100% enhancement was measured between the same set of surfaces. Although the results highlight the inadequacy of characterizing nucleate pool boiling data using Ra, the observed effect of roughness was correlated using h∝Ram as has been done in several prior studies. The experimental results were compared with predictions from several widely used correlations in the literature.","2009-12-01","2021-05-27 20:56:27","2021-05-27 20:56:27","2021-05-27 20:56:27","121009","","12","131","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\bonga\OneDrive\Zliterature\BOiling\surface_modifications\2009_Jones et al_The Influence of Surface Roughness on Nucleate Pool Boiling Heat Transfer.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
